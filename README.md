## Overview of System Functionality

This project is a simple HTML webpage that displays:

- Full Name
- Course Name
- Major
- A custom message (“Hello, World!”)

The webpage was designed using semantic HTML and minimal CSS for clarity. It is deployed on a free hosting platform so that it can be accessed publicly via URL.

## Public URL

[Paste your deployed page URL here once it’s live]

## Known Issues or Assumptions

- This is a static HTML page with no dynamic functionality.
- Page layout was tested in modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
- Mobile responsiveness is handled with the viewport meta tag.
- No external CSS/JS libraries were used; the design is self-contained.

---

## Files Included

- `index.html` — the main HTML page
- `results.png` — screenshot of the page output
- `README.md` — this documentation
